Last week's [Paris Open Source Summit](http://www.opensourcesummit.paris/) was a very successful event by all accounts - on the whole and more particularly for the PCU project. A round of applause for the organizers, please : full conference rooms, overflowing boothes and alleys, a gullwinged Tesla and brimming with unmistakable energy - no doubt, this will be a Paris Open Source Summit for the ages.

And what about PCU ? Well, very simply put, PCU has delivered its first release, even if still in beta : [PCU Entreprise Search - try it out](https://owncloud.smile.eu/s/6toBC6N2VJv4EHC) ! Even better, it is at the heart of a [new Entreprise Search solution offering](https://www.smile.eu/fr/technologies/pcu-enterprise-search) by Smile. Indeed, it's been some time that we've seen this kind of needs at our customers', and now we have an asset to build our answers on.

Here's a screenshot :

This new product has been showcased along with a live demo at the Paris Open Source Summit in a conference in the [Dematerialization track](http://www.opensourcesummit.paris/preinscription-conferences.html) - which I incidentally had the pleasure of helping lead - as an illustration of how to rethink Entreprise Search solutions in the Big Data era.

In short, by integrating Big Data components in a pluggable, flexible way, PCU allows for "à la carte" deployments of gradually increasing scale and functionalities :
- deploying only ElasticSearch is enough to be able to use PCU Entreprise Search
- adding Kafka enables scalable indexing, by going through asynchronous, partitioned message topics (the current version also needs Spark as an intermediary ETL engine)
- later, adding Spark will allow to use intelligent features, such as search and recommendation that take advantage of Spark ML algorithms.

In details... well, have a look at the slides :

Finally, as a first time track lead, I've been very pleased by the attendance, both in quantity - sorry to those who had to stand up ! - and in quality, with a lot of insightful questions. So thank you all and see you next year !
